<pre><code>appium-doctor
</code></pre>

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hy1984427/appium/master/images/appium_doctor.png "appium-doctor")

The green check mark of all settings indicate us that we can start next chapter - execute the existing appium demos from its source.

***You can also use the appium-doctor in the appium GUI tool to verify sesstings.***
