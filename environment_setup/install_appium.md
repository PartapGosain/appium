# Install appium

***It's better to install appium through command line, rather than just download appium, since appium GUI app is more fragile.***

***Make sure you have not installed Node or Appium with sudo, otherwise youâ€™ll run into problems***

<pre><code>brew install node      # get node.js
npm install -g appium  # get appium
npm install wd         # get appium client
appium               # start appium

for Android
brew install ant
brew install maven
</code></pre>
