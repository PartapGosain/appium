In the inspector, we can see the elements listed in tree structure, and once we clicked on them, corresponding element will be highlighted in the right preview panel.

Tap on `Record` button, we can perform actions to the app, and the actions will be recorded automatically into the script below. And the script can be switched among many languages.

To get actions recorded, we can only perform actions in the action field, which is just below the "Tree structured element selector".
