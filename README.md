This is an appium handbook using Ruby, including environment setup and basic scripts and migrate them into Cucumber features.

The handbook is written based on appium v1.1.0.

In appium v1.2.0, the "deviceNAME“ is became mandatory, so we need add this parameter to our script. ＊The value can be anything*
