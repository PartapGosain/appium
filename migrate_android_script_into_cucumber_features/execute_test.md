# Execute test

First of all, we need to start Android emulator.

And in the "Terminal", we need to strat `appium` first, then go to the Android Cucumber folder, and run `cucumber` to execute "mms.feature".

And we will get the tests all "Pass":

Now the "android_cucumber" folder should contain following folders and files:

The last one is the screenshot when the message is discarded.

You can refer to the Android Cucumber script from [here](https://github.com/hy1984427/appium/tree/master/scripts/android_cucumber).

This is all for Android.

Now, it's your turn to use them in your project, with BDD, Page Object and other techniques.

For BDD and Page Object with Cucumber, you can refer to another handbook of mine: [BDD with PageObject](http://hy1984427.github.io/BDD-with-PageObject/).

Have fun!
