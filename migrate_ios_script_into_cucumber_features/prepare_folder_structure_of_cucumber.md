# Prepare folder structure of cucumber

First we need to create a folder to contain all the files - features and steps. We will use `~/Documents/appium-master/sample-code/examples/ruby/ios_cucumber` for demo.

And under it, we need to create a folder `features`.

Beneath "features", we need `step_definitions` and `support`.

Now, we have the basic folder structure, we need to add features and steps in them.
