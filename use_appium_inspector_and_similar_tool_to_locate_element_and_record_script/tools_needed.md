# Tools needed

Appium provides us a useful tool to find the elements in iOS simulator, and record the script corresponding to our actions.

We need to download the appium GUI tool from http://appium.io/

For Android emulator, Android SDK provide us a similar one - uiautomatorviewer, but without the Record freature.

And for Android, we also need to use Genymotion, which is a faster emulator than the AVD provided by Android SDK. To install Genymotion, we also need to install VirtualBox.

To download VirtualBox and Genymotion, please go to following sites:
